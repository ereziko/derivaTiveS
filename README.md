# derivaTiveS
A type Script for finding polynomials derivatives

The script contains 3 parts:
  1. Methods for handling a basic math node in the form ax^b.
  2. Methods for handling a math expression, which might consist of some math nodes.
  3. Several test cases.

# How to run:
tsc derive.ts && node derive.js

# What to do:
1. Preprocessing - Add trigonometric functions support
2. Language Support - Aggergate of elements in input
3. Language Support - Add parenthesis handling
